# Marky-mark

Marky-mark helps you consume all your markdown files used for static-site generation. 

It reads a directory of files with yaml meta-data/front-matter and parses it out. 
And if the extension is a markdown one it'll generate the html of that markdown. 
Add your favorite templating language to make your own static site generator. 

## Up for adoption

If you would like to take ownership of this module or have publishing rights let me know.

## Usage

Let's assume you have a folder of markdown files that optionally have front-matter/meta-data, looking something like this:

```markdown
--- 
title: Marky Mark. A retrospective.
tags:
  - music
  - 90s
whatever: you want
---

## A Blog Post
 
A blog post about how I can't believe Mark Wahlberg is Marky Mark. 
Written in markdown of course.
```

You can use marky-mark to easily grab all that data and stick it in an array of javascript objects. 

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
var posts = mm.parseDirectorySync(__dirname + "/path/to/posts");
```

or

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
mm.parseDirectory(__dirname + "/path/to/posts", function(err, posts) {
  console.log(posts);
});
```

The output will be an array of objects, with each object representing 1 file. 
The front-matter/meta-data is parsed via js-yaml. 
The parsed result is in the meta property, but the original yaml content is stored in the yaml property in case you want to do something with it.

```javascript
// this is what .parseDirectorySync() and .parseDirectory() return
[
  {
    filename: "My Marky Mark post.md",
    yaml: "title: Marky Mark. A retrospective.\ntags: ...",
    markdown: "\n## A Blog Post\n\nA blog post about how I ...",
    content: "<h2>A Blog Post</h2><p>A blog post about how I ...",
    meta: {
      title: "Marky Mark. A retrospective.",
      tags: ["music", "90s"],
      whatever: "you want"
    }
  },
  {
    // ... another file's contents ...
  }
]
```

And that's it. It's up to you to do something with all the data marky-mark just read.

## API

### parseDirectorySync

Parse all markdown files in a given directory, returning a list of context objects.

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
var pages = mm.parseDirectorySync('./views/staticPages');
```

### parseMatchesSync

Like `parseDirectorySync`, parses markdown files in a given directory, but accepts patterns for filtering.

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
var pages = mm.parseMatchesSync('./views', ['posts/**/*.md', 'pages/**/*.md', '!**/README.md']);
```

### parseFileSync

Parse a single markdown file.

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
var obj = mm.parseFileSync('./views/pages/faq.md');
```

### parseFilesSync

Parse multiple markdown files

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
var obj = mm.parseFilesSync(['./views/pages.faq.md', './views/pages/about-me.md']);
```

### parse

Parse a literal markdown string. This is a low-level function used internally by the library, but you might find an independent use for it.

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
var obj = mm.parse('# A title\n\n## A subtitle');
```

### parseDirectory

Parse all markdown files in a given directory, returning a list of context objects.

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
mm.parseDirectorySync('./views/staticPages', function(err, pages) {
  
});
```

### parseMatches

Like `parseDirectorySync`, parses markdown files in a given directory, but accepts patterns for filtering.

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
mm.parseMatchesSync('./views', ['posts/**/*.md', 'pages/**/*.md', '!**/README.md'], function(err, pages) {
  
});
```

### parseFile

Parse a single markdown file.

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
mm.parseFileSync('./views/pages/faq.md', function(err, obj) {
  
});
```

### parseFiles

Parse multiple markdown files

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
mm.parseFilesSync(['./views/pages.faq.md', './views/pages/about-me.md'], function(err, objs) {
  
});
```
### Options

All the above methods accept optional `options` as the second parameter, where possible options include:

* preCompile: A function to call with de-ymled markdown. Accepts (and returns) a markdown string.
* postCompile: A function to call with processed html. Accepts (and returns) an html string.
* context: An object of additional context properties (extends the front-matter, if any).
* marked: Options to pass directly to the marked module.

A synchronous usage with options:

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
var obj = mm.parseFileSync('./views/pages/faq.md', {
  marked: {
    gfm: true, // Default
    tables: false
  },
  preCompile: function(md) {
    return md.replace('foo', 'bar');
  }
});
```

An asynchronous usage with options:

```javascript
var mm = require('marky-mark');
mm.parseFile('./views/pages/faq.md', {
  context: {
    // foo will be added to the "meta" object
    foo: 'bar'
  },
  postCompile: function(html) {
    return html.replace('h1', 'h2');
  }
}, function(err, obj) {

});
```

## Recommended Pairings

Because marky-mark doesn't do anything but read and parse files meant for static-site generators, you'll want to pair it up with other sweet modules to create your own site generator (the funky-bunch approach).

Here are some suggested modules that are fun to use with marky-mark:

- a templating library ([EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs), [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade), [eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco), [handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js), [mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js), etc.)
- a date formatting library (such as [moment](https://github.com/moment/moment))
- a build tool ([grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt))
- a map/reduce or javascript object querying library (I've found [taffydb](https://github.com/typicaljoe/taffydb) to be super helpful. There's also [underscore](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore) and [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash).)
- a css preprocessor (like [less](https://github.com/less/less.js))

If you want to get even crazier, add an http server and a file-watching thing. 
Then you can generate your site automatically as you write, and see a live preview.
Level up your system and automate your deployment.
